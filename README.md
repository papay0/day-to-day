# day-to-day

day-to-day is a task manager.
You have 3 categories:

1. Your day to day tasks.
2. Promotion; you can write the work you're proud of and you think can be useful when it's time to write your promo package.
3. Standup; is a copy of your Today day to day section, useful to read just before your daily standup.

## Setup

git clone
cd day-to-day
npm install
npm start
